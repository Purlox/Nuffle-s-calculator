Nuffle's calculator
===================

_For when you want to know how easily Nuffle can screw you over._

In other words, it's a calculator of percentages to fail/succeed any given roll in Blood Bowl (and hopefully later) also a combination of rolls.

The calculations and everything else is done currently according to the Living Rulebook 6, that can be found (here)[http://www.bloodbowlgamers.com/downloads/LRB6.pdf]. I believe it's also what Blood Bowl 2 uses as its rules, considering it hosts this one on their site, but I can't be completely sure.
